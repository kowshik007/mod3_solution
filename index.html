			<p>
                Chicken cooked in fiery desi flavors is a dream come true for all non-vegetarians. Apart from being a very versatile meat when it comes to cooking, chicken also promises great health benefits. Did you know that the human body can derive about 30 different nutritional substances from just 100 grams of chicken? Chicken is a great source of lean, low fat protein. It is also packed with selenium, a chemical known for its anti-cancer properties. The skin of the chicken is known to contain the maximum fat; therefore skinned chicken is preferred by many.

				Beef
			</h3>
			<p>Beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, accounting for about 25% of meat production worldwide, after pork and poultry at 38% and 30% respectively. In absolute numbers, the United States, Brazil, and the People's Republic of China are the world's three largest consumers of beef; Uruguay, however, has the highest beef and veal consumption per capita, followed by Argentina and Brazil. According to the data from OECD, the average Uruguayan ate over 42 kg (93 lb) of beef or veal in 2014, representing the highest beef/veal consumption per capita in the world. In comparison, the average American consumed only about 24 kg (53 lb) beef or veal in the same year, while African countries, such as Mozambique, Ghana, and Nigeria, consumed the least beef or veal per capita.</p>

			<h3 class="text-center">Sushi</h3>
			<p>
				Sushi is the Japanese preparation and serving of cooked vinegared rice combined with varied ingredients, chiefly seafood, vegetables, meat (usually fish), and occasionally tropical fruits. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the key ingredient in all cases is the rice, also referred to as shari or sumeshi.
			</p>
			<p>
                Sushi can be prepared with either brown or white rice. It is often prepared with raw seafood, but some common varieties of sushi use cooked ingredients, and many other sorts are vegetarian. Sushi is often served with pickled ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish is popular as a garnish.
